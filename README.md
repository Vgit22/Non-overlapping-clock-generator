Abstract-In this work, a non-overlapping clock generato has been proposed. It employs a current starved voltage controlled oscillator and clock synchronizer circuit. The current starved voltage controlled oscillator has been realized using CMOS ring oscillators. The proposed circuit has benn simulated using synopsys custom compiler in 28nm CMOS technology.
