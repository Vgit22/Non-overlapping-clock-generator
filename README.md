# Non-overlapping clock generator for micro scale energy harvesting applications in 28nm CMOS technology
### Abstract: 
* This report presents a non overlapping clock generator for micro scale energy harvesting applications. 
* The clock generator employs a current starved voltage controlled oscillator, D flip flop and clock synchronizer circuit.
* The current starved voltage controlled oscillator has been realized using CMOS ring oscillators.
* The proposed circuit has been simulated using synopsys custom compiler in 28nm CMOS technology.
